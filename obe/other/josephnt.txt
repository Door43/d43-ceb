Si Jose ang kalibotanong amahan ni Jesus ug ang nagpadako kaniya.

  * Si Jose kaliwat ni Haring David.
  * Si Jose nakapamalayi na sa usa ka ulay nga babaye nga ginganlan ug Maria, si kinsa maoy gipili sa Dios nga mahimong inahan ni Jesus, ang Mesiyas.
  * Ang usa ka anghel nagsulti kang Jose nga ang balaang Espirito maoy naghimong mabdos kang Maria sa milagrosong paagi, ug ang bata nga gisabak ni Maria mao ang anak sa Dios.
  * Nituo si Jose sa anghel ug gituman niya ang Dios pinaagi sa iyang pagminyo kang Maria.
  * Wala hilabti ni Jose si Maria hangtod nga natawo si Jesus.

  ***[[:ceb:obs:notes:frames:22-04|[22-04]]]** She (Mary) was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named **Joseph**.
  ***[[:ceb:obs:notes:frames:23-01|[23-01]]]** **Joseph**, the man Mary was engaged to, was a righteous man. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame her, so he planned to quietly divorce her.
  ***[[:ceb:obs:notes:frames:23-02|[23-02]]]** The angel said, "**Joseph**, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby in her body is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means, 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins."
  ***[[:ceb:obs:notes:frames:23-03|[23-03]]]** So **Joseph** married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.
  ***[[:ceb:obs:notes:frames:23-04|[23-04]]]** **Joseph** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.
  ***[[:ceb:obs:notes:frames:26-04|[26-04]]]** Jesus said, "The words I just read to you are happening right now." All the people were amazed. "Isn't this the son of **Joseph**?" they said.
