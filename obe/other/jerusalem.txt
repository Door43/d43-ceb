====== Jerusalem ======

===== Kamatuoran: =====

Ang Jerusalem usa ka karaang siyudad sa Canaanhon ug nahimo nga siyudad sa Israel ug sentro sa politikanhon ug relihiyosong bulohaton. Naa gihapon kini didto hangtod karon ug usa ka sentro nga siyudad Israel.

  * Ang siyudad sa Salem sa Daang Kasabotan mao ra pud tingali ang siyudad sa Jerusalem. Ang duha ka ngalan naggikan sa pulong nga nagpasabot ug "kalinaw."
  * Abraham offered his son Isaac on Mount Moriah which is part of the city of Jerusalem.
  * Giilog kini ni Haring David kaniadto gikan sa Jebusihanon ug gihimo niya kini nga sentro nga siyudad..
  *

Nahimo ang templo didto sa Jerusalem ug ang anak ni David nga si Haring Solomon maoy nakabuhat niini.

  *

Gisugo sa Dios ang mga taga-Babilonia aron pagguba sa Jerusalem tungod sa sala sa Israel. Apan gipabalik gihapon niya sila didto, ug paglabay sa 70 ka tuig, giayo nila ang Jerusalem.

  * Because the temple was located there, Jerusalem was the center for celebrating the major Jewish festivals.
  * In the New Testament, Jesus was dedicated as a baby at the temple in Jerusalem and it was in Jerusalem where he was put on trial and sentenced to die on a cross.
  * After Jesus came back to life, Jerusalem was one of the main places where Jesus spent time with his disciples before he returned to heaven.
  * Since Jerusalem was located in the mountains of Israel, people normally referred to going to Jerusalem as "going up to Jerusalem."
