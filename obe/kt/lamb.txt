===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If sheep are known in the language area, the name for their young should be used to translate the terms "lamb" and "Lamb of God."
  * "Lamb of God" could be translated as "God's (sacrificial) Lamb," or "Lamb sacrificed to God" or "(sacrificial) Lamb from God."
  * If sheep are not known, this term could be translated as "the young of a sheep" with a footnote that describes what sheep are like. The note could also compare sheep and lambs to an animal from that area that lives in herds, is timid and defenseless, and which often wanders off.
  * Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation of a nearby local or national language. (See: [[ceb:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]])
