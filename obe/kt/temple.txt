===== Kamatuoran: =====

Ang Templo mao ang balay (simbahanan) kon diin maghalad ang mga Israelita ngado sa Dios. Nahimutang kini sa Bungtod sa Moria sa siyudad sa Jerusalem.

  *

Usahay ang pulong nga “Templo” nagapasabot sa tibuok lugar nga natindogan sa templo apil na ang mga tugkaran nga milibot sa nahimutangan niini. Usahay usab nga ang nagtindong lang nga balay ang gipasabot niini.

  * Ang gipatindog nga temple adunay duha ka kuwarto, ang Balaang Dapit ug ang Labing Balaang Dapit.
  * Nag-ingon ang Dios nga puy-anan niya ang templo.
  * Sa Bag-ong Kasabotan, ang pulong "templo sa Balaang Espiritu" naghisgot mahitungod sa mga magtutuo kang Jeus, tungod kay anaa na kanila ang Balaang Espiritu.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Usually when the text says that people were "in the temple," it is referring to the courtyards outside the building. This could be translated as "in the temple courtyards" or "in the temple complex."
  * When it refers specifically to the building itself, some translations will translate "temple" as "temple building," to make it clear what is being referred to.
  * Ways to translate "temple" could include, "God's holy house" or "sacred worship place."
  * Often in the Bible, the temple is referred to as "the house of Yahweh" or "the house of God."
