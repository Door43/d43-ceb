===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

  * **Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursemaids**  - AT: "Kings and queens from the nations will take care of you and your children"
  * **lick the dust of your feet**  - At that time, people bowed to the ground to show their submission to a king. This is a sign that kings and queens will completely humble themselves and respect Zion.
  * **will not be put to shame**  - AT: "I will not put to shame" (See: [[:ceb:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
