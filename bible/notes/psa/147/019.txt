===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **word ... statutes ... decrees** - These words all speak of what "he proclaimed," the Law of Moses. If your language does not have different words for these terms, you may combine the two lines into one, using either "Jacob" or "Israel" for the people who heard the words proclaimed. (See: [[ceb:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
