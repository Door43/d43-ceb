Sa dihang nadungog na kini sa katawhan, nangayo sila ug pasaylo sa ilang pagpakasala. Unya ilang gikuha ang ilang mga hinagiban aron sulungon ang katawhan sa Canaan. Gipahimangnoan sila ni Moises nga dili modayon tungod kay ang Dios dili muoban kanila, apan wala sila naminaw kaniya.

===== Mahinungdanon nga mga Pulong: =====

  * **[[:ceb:obe:kt:sin|sala, makasasala, sad-an, pagpakasala]]**
  * **[[:ceb:obe:other:canaan|Canaan, Canaanhon]]**
  * **[[:ceb:obe:other:moses|Moises]]**
  * **[[:ceb:obe:kt:god|Dios]]**
==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **they had sinned**  - It may be necessary to add, "they had sinned by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan."
  * **Moses warned them not to go**  - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that.
  * **God was not with them**  â€“ In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
  * **but they did not listen to him**  - They did not obey Moses. They went to attack the Canaanites anyway.
