God told Rebekah, "Two nations will come from the two sons inside of you. They will struggle with each other and the older son will serve the younger one."

When Rebekah's babies were born, the older son came out red and hairy, and they named him Esau. Then the younger son came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob.
